Enable GPU-PV easily

##
GPU Partition is a new Microsoft GPU virtualization technology avaiable in latest Win10 and Win11. However it is not configurable in a easy way( no GUI avaiable). This repository provides scripts for both Windows and Linux to enable GPU-PV easily.

## For Windows 10+
Just download 'win-gpu-pv.ps1' and execute with Administrator priviledge. This script was inspired by (dantmnf)[https://gist.github.com/dantmnf/9bf9972c1ad49029cbdc2e40f1b7ac51]

## For Ubuntu
coming soon.
