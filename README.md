Enable GPU-PV easily

##
GPU Partition is a new Microsoft GPU virtualization technology avaiable in latest Win10 and Win11. However it is not configurable in a easy way( no GUI avaiable). This repository provides scripts for both Windows and Linux to enable GPU-PV easily.

## For Windows 10+
Just download 'win-gpu-pv.ps1' and execute with Administrator priviledge.

## For Ubuntu
coming soon.
